* Pennsylvania Policy Database analysis tool.

This is a Java Server Pages application that allows users to select one or more
of the database tables from the Pennsylvania Policy Database.  Selection criteria
include a range of years (or legislative sessions), filters, and policy topics.
The selected data is presented as a graph of counts by year (or session) and
a drill-down table that allows viewing of the individual records for each year
(session). A download of the selected data as an excel 2007 spreadsheet is also
provided.

This web application is modeled on the original U. S. Policy Agenda's project. It
is written in a way that allows for adaptation to other Policy Agenda's projects
datasets.
